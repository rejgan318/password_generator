# Password generator

Tested on Windows. [On Linux pyperclip](https://pypi.org/project/pyperclip/), this module makes use of the xclip or xsel commands, which should come with the os. Otherwise run “sudo apt-get install xclip” or “sudo apt-get install xsel” (Note: xsel does not always seem to work.)
Otherwise on Linux, you will need the gtk or PyQt4 modules installed.
